Our project focuses on studying the patterns of immigration to the United States over time. We will be analyzing immigration trends from the years of 2005 - 2014. We will be comparing the number of immigrant naturalized versus the number of immigrants naturalized from different countries. We wanted to emphasize the countries that were a part of the Trump travel ban and wanted to see how their immigration patterns faired against other countries. The countries involved in th Trump travel ban will be distinguished by color. Our project will give users the options to select which countries they would like to compare. All these countries and their immigration information will be displayed on a graph, with circles representing different countries.
